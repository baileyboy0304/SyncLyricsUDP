# Music Assistant Integration

This guide explains how to connect SyncLyrics to [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/) for real-time lyrics display.

## Prerequisites

- Music Assistant server running (standalone or Home Assistant add-on)
- API token (generated in MA web UI)

## Getting Your Credentials

### 1. Server URL

Your Music Assistant server URL is typically:
- `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:8095` (standalone)
- `http://<HA_IP>:8095` (Home Assistant add-on)

### 2. API Token

1. Open your Music Assistant web UI
2. Go to **Settings** → **Security**
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "SyncLyrics")
5. Copy the generated token

> ⚠️ **Security Note**: The token grants full access to your MA server. Keep it secure.

## Configuration

### Recommended: Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file or system environment:

```bash
SYSTEM_MUSIC_ASSISTANT_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8095
SYSTEM_MUSIC_ASSISTANT_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

For Docker/Home Assistant, add as environment variables in your deployment config.

### Alternative: settings.json

> ⚠️ **Not Recommended**: `settings.json` is not secure for sensitive data like tokens.

```json
{
    "system.music_assistant.server_url": "http://192.168.1.100:8095",
    "system.music_assistant.token": "your_token_here",
    "system.music_assistant.player_id": ""
}
```

### Optional: Specific Player

If you have multiple players and want to target a specific one:

```bash
SYSTEM_MUSIC_ASSISTANT_PLAYER_ID=your_player_id
```

Leave empty to auto-detect (uses first playing/paused player).

## Latency Tuning

### The Problem

Music Assistant streams audio over your network to various players (Chromecast, Sonos, AirPlay, etc.). This introduces latency that varies by:
- Network conditions
- Player type and buffer settings
- MA server load

Without compensation, lyrics may appear **too early** because SyncLyrics receives position updates before the audio actually plays on your speaker. Sometimes they may appear **too late** too.

### The Solution

Add a latency offset to delay lyrics display:

```json
"lyrics.display.music_assistant_latency_compensation": -0.5,
```

This value is in **seconds**. Start with `-0.5` and adjust:
- **Lyrics too early** → Make more negative (e.g., -0.6, -0.8)
- **Lyrics too late** → Make more positive (e.g., +0.1, +0.5)

### Tuning Tips

1. Play a song you know well
2. Watch if lyrics appear before or after the vocals
3. Adjust in 0.1 increments until synced
4. Different players may need different values

> 📖 See [Latency Tuning Guide](Latency%20Tuning%20Guide.md) for detailed explanation of how latency compensation works.

## Troubleshooting

### "No Music Assistant player available"

- Ensure MA server is running and accessible
- Check that at least one player exists in MA
- Verify your server URL is correct

### Connection keeps dropping

- Check network stability between SyncLyrics and MA server
- MA server may be restarting or updating
- SyncLyrics auto-reconnects with exponential backoff

### Like button not working

- Ensure the track exists in your MA library
- Some streaming providers may not support favorites
- Check MA logs for errors

### Wrong player detected

Set `SYSTEM_MUSIC_ASSISTANT_PLAYER_ID` to your preferred player's ID.

To find your player ID:
1. Open MA web UI
2. Go to **Players**
3. Click on your player
4. The ID is in the URL or settings panel

## Connection Status

SyncLyrics maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to MA. When connected:
- Metadata updates in real-time
- No polling overhead
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect

Check your SyncLyrics logs for connection status:
```
INFO: Connected to Music Assistant
INFO: Music Assistant disconnected
DEBUG: Reconnecting to Music Assistant (attempt 2)
```

## Setting Music Assistant as Default Source

If you want to set Music Assistant as your default source, always, a simple way is to make use of our existing settings: 

1) Set MA to the highest priority, even -1 will work. This makes it win over any other source. 

2) Set Music Assistant 'paused timeout' to 0, or a very high number (in seconds, such as 14400). 

This creates 'source stickiness', where MA will stay as the active source even when it's paused, showing you the last song you played on MA, no matter how old it is.

You can then use all playback controls/device picker to resume MA playback anytime.
